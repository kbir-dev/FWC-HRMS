## Step 1: Get Your FREE API Key

1. Go to: **https://openrouter.ai/keys**
2. Sign in with Google/GitHub (no credit card needed!)
3. Click **"Create Key"**
4. Copy your API key (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)

**That's it!** No billing setup required!

---

## Step 2: Add API Key to Your Project

### Option A: Update .env file (Recommended)

1. Open `backend/.env` file (create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Add these lines:

```env
# Set OpenRouter as the primary AI provider
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter

# Your OpenRouter API key (FREE!)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-actual-key-here
```

### Option B: Copy from env.example.txt

```bash
cd backend
cp env.example.txt .env
```

Then edit `.env` and update the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` line with your actual key.

---

## Step 3: Restart Backend

The backend will auto-restart (nodemon is watching), or restart manually:

```bash
# Ctrl+C to stop if running
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
âœ“ Initialized OpenRouter as primary AI provider (FREE tier)
```

2. No extra spaces in the `.env` file
3. Backend restarted after adding the key

### "No AI providers configured"

**Check**:
1. `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
2. `AI_PROVIDER=openrouter` is set
3. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set

### Still using Gemini?

**Check**:
1. Make sure `AI_PROVIDER=openrouter` (not `gemini`)
2. Restart backend completely
