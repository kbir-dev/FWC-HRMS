}
```

**Functionality:**

   - Gross Salary = base salary
   - Net Salary = gross - tax
5. Inserts payroll records with status 'pending'
6. Logs audit trail
7. Returns count of processed employees

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Payroll processed successfully for 15 employees",
  "count": 15,
  "month": 10,
  "year": 2025
}
```

**Authorization:** Requires `admin` or `hr` role

**Endpoint Updated:**
```javascript
POST /api/performance
```

**Changes:**
- Simplified to accept snake_case (frontend format)

```json
{
  "employee_id": 5,
  "review_period_start": "2025-01-01",
  "review_period_end": "2025-10-29",
  "overall_score": 7,
  "strengths": "Great teamwork...",
  "areas_for_improvement": "Time management...",
  "goals": "Complete certification...",
  "comments": "Overall good performance"
}
```

**Functionality:**
1. Validates required fields
2. Gets reviewer ID from authenticated user's employee profile
3. Inserts review with all scores set to overall_score
4. Logs audit trail
5. Returns created review
